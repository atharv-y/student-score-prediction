# student-score-prediction
We predict score in percentage for given study hours using Python libraries and Machine Learning.
Libraries used: Seaborn, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
Seaborn is a visualization library.
Pandas is used to structure and manipulate unstructured, raw data.
Scikit-learn is used for applying machine learning algorithms on the structured data for predictions.
